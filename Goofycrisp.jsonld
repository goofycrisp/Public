    "motivations": "Cardano has massive potential, but it requires bold thinking, smart resource allocation, and real builders leading the way. I’ve been part of this ecosystem since 2017, and today, I want to use my voice to back the people, products, and ideas that can make Cardano thrive. I’m motivated by outcomes — not politics — and want to help bring clarity, momentum, and accountability to on-chain governance.",
    "objectives": "My goal as a DRep is simple: support what truly grows the Cardano ecosystem. I believe in making smart, strategic decisions — prioritizing initiatives that offer the highest impact with the right balance of risk and reward. As a Snek core contributor and long-time community member, I want to ensure that treasury and governance decisions fuel innovation, adoption, and long-term value creation.",

    "qualifications": "I'm a builder, engineer, and team leader with a strong background in product development, market analysis, and finance. As a Snek core contributor, I’ve helped launch and grow one of Cardano’s most adopted tokens — not just by hype, but by delivering real volume, products, users, and visibility to the chain. I understand how to evaluate opportunities, manage trade-offs, and lead teams toward high-impact outcomes. I bring a data-driven mindset, deep market knowledge, and a proven ability to turn ideas into results.",
